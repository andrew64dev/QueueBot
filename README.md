# QueueBot

This bot was the Physiological Hub (https://discord.gg/UQDJ266AUK) old queue managment bot. This bot is now deprecated. Please do not join the server asking for problems with this bot, no one will help you.
Technically, this bot was Open-Source all the time, because it was hosted on Replit, so i could not set it private.
This bot is written very badly. Use it as your own risk!
This bot is written with Python and the Pycord library, and the prefix are Slash commands.
If you have a question (not about the code), please join the server, ping andrew64dev and ask your question.
Also, if you think of using this for a big server, this bot used all the 2 gigs of space. The server haves 1K members, so its better if you opt with a database (you need to edit the code for this) or get a machine with atleast 12 gigs of space.
